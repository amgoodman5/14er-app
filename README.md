# 14er App

The 14er app is a resource for people interested in hiking 14ers (mountain peaks 14,000ft+ in Colorado). All official 14ers are listed along with additional information about each and the most popular related trails. I created my own API with all the 14er mountain and trail data to populate the app's content.
